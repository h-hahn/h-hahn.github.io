    "text": "I am currently pursuing a Master of Environmental Data Science in the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Aquatic Biology from UC Santa Barbara in 2022, where I became passionate about research with environmental applications. I gained experience working on molecular scales while working with DNA in various disease ecology labs. The results of my laboratory procedures were used to gain a better understanding of patterns and ecological impacts of specific diseases in the environment. This highlighted the importance of understanding data, as laboratory results only have an impact when the data is analyzed properly. To expand my knowledge in data processing, I undertook a senior thesis project that aimed to use citizen science data to analyze patterns between anthropogenic stressors and coral-macroalgal phase shifts on coral reefs globally. As I pursue my Master’s degree and continue to work in the Briggs lab at UCSB, I hope to continue to use my knowledge in data science and biology to improve the quality of ecological research by transforming data into results that will have real-world, environmental applications."

    "text": "Bias in Ecological Research\n\nA preface on my own thoughts and experience in research\nAlthough I have been working in environmental research for the past few years (my own background involves amphibian disease), I am embarrassed to admit that I have yet to consider how bias is involved in my own field of research, especially as the research I have been performing does not directly relate to humans. I used to think that biases only impacted underrepresented communities of humans and thought about it in terms of socio-economic impacts, but have not thought of how biases affect conservation and ecology as well. The scales that I work on are so small and local, that I rarely consider wide scale impacts of our research, and in my undergraduate courses, I would absorb all of the ecological concepts without considering where this research takes place and how bias can be involved in the collection of this information. It is interesting to consider how bias arises in ecology and conservation on global scales.\n\n\nThe importance in representing all areas in ecology\nMany studies establish ecological concepts that are meant to be applied to a wide range of environments regardless of location. Due to the fact that these principles and concepts are applied to such a wide range of habitats and systems, it is important to consider the origins of this research; however if there are biases excluding certain environmental systems, we must be wary and careful in applying these broad ecological ideas to any system.\n\n\nGlobal patterns of bias\nAround the world, there appears to be a pattern in which sampling and research locations are not evenly distributed - based on the most “popular” ecological research, determined by publications from 10 highly cited ecology journals. In 2012, Martin et al. analyzed the global distribution of 2573 terrestrial ecological studies and found that there are many biases in the locations chosen to conduct ecological research. The figure below is figure 1 from Martin et al. (2012), showing the proportion of studies in different land contexts.\n\nThis figure shows that agriculture and densely settled locations are largely underrepresented compared to the actual proportion of land that they take up globally. On the other hand, protected areas are largely overrepresented. Intuitively, it makes sense that scientists are focused on conservation in protected areas, as these areas are likely protected for a reason. However, this does not mean that other locations should be disregarded. The lack of research in densely settled populations is ironic, especially when considering that most research in densely settled areas are conducted in the “natural” parts of these locations (Martin et al. 2012), as the lack of research hinders conservation in these areas, and these locations are likely areas where anthropogenic impacts are deteriorating “natural” systems at faster rates. One would think that we would want to study anthropogenic impacts in densely settled areas more aggressively than areas that are already protected.\nAdditionally, on a country scale, “the Middle East was the most significantly understudied region based on land area, by a factor of 8.3, followed by Africa, Asia, and South America” (Martin et al. 2012). Countries with higher gross national incomes (GNI) are largely overstudied, with 90% of the studies taking place in countries in the 70-100th percentiles of GNI (Martin et al. 2012). (Zina Skandrani digs into the cause of the bias against North Africa and the Middle East in “Decolonizing ecological research”!)\n\n\n\nThis map is from figure 3a of Martin et al. 2012, depicting the global distribution of ecological field sites.\n\n\nDisregarding the environmental justice issues that these statistics imply, almost completely leaving out certain countries means that many different types of biomes are being left out of ecological research. When the same types of biomes are being repeatedly sampled, we must be careful to extrapolate ecological principles to all biomes. In particular, the biases against countries with low GNI has led to underrepresentation of desert ecosystems (Durant et al. 2012).\nWhen considering the conclusions of ecological research, we must be vigilant and responsible in considering how biases in study location can affect the implications of the results of the study. If most studies are conducted in wealthy countries with temperate biomes, we cannot confidently apply those broad ecological concepts to less wealthy countries with desert biomes. When ecologists do not consider biases in study locations, they are also skewing conservation efforts, as conservation efforts are neglected in areas that are not being studied.\n\n\nAdditional Thoughts\nAs I was researching bias in ecological research, I also came across a paper addressing the understanding of bias among ecologists. According to the study, knowledge and understanding of bias among ecologists is low, and early career scientists are more likely to understand bias and measures to prevent it than senior scientists (Zvereva & Kozlov 2021). I would be curious to understand whether this is because early career scientists have more recently learned about biases more recently, or because when senior scientists first entered their careers, discussion about bias was less common. In either case, would continuing education on biases and avoiding biases help keep scientists more accountable? Zvereva and Kozlov introduce the idea of obligatory reporting measures taken against biases to enhance reproducibility, which links to the idea of datasheets for datasets, introduced by Gebru et al., which may not be a bad idea in the field of ecology.\n\n\nReferences\nDurant SM, Pettorelli N, Bashir S, Woodroffe R, Wacher T, de Ornellas P, Ransom C, Abaigar T, Abdelgardir M, Elalqamy H, Beddiaf M, Belbachir F, Belbachir-Bazi A, Berbash AA, Beudels-Jamar R, Boitani L, Breitenmoser C, Cano M, Chardonnet P, Collen B, Corniforth WA, Cuzin F, Gerngross P, Haddane B, Hadjeloum M, Jacobson A, Jebali A, Lamarque F, Mallon D, Minkowski K, Monfort S, Ndossal B, Newby J, Ngakoutou BE, Niagate b, Purchase G, Smaila S, Samna AK, Sillero-Zubiri C, Soultan AE, Price MRS, Baillie JEM.

    "text": "The Analysis\nImport Libraries\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport rioxarray as rioxr\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n\nData Wrangling and Tidying\nImport Datasets\n\n\nCode\n# read in data for 2017 daily AQI by county\naqi_17 = pd.read_csv('https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/daily_aqi_by_county_2017.zip')\n\n# read data for 2018 Daily AQI by county\naqi_18 = pd.read_csv('https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/daily_aqi_by_county_2018.zip')\n\n# import landsat file\nlandsat1 = os.path.join(os.getcwd(),'data','landsat8-2018-01-26-sb-simplified.nc')\nlandsat = rioxr.open_rasterio(landsat1)\n\n# import fire perimiters dataset\ncal_fire = gpd.read_file('data/California_Fire_Perimeters_2017')\n\n\nThe first step of this analysis was to read in the data. Air quality index datasets (by county) for 2017 and 2018 were read in from .zip files accessed through the US EPA. I used rioxarray.open_rasterio() to read in the landsat satellite data and geopandas.read_file() to read in the California fire perimeters data.\nThen the datasets needed to be cleaned to prepare for visualization:\nPrepare AQI Data\n\n\nCode\n# preparing aqi data\n\n# glue dataframes together\naqi = pd.concat([aqi_17, aqi_18])\n\n# re-assign the column names - .str.lower() makes them lower case\naqi.columns = aqi.columns.str.lower()\n\n#  re-assign the column names again - .str.replace(' ','_') replaces the space for _\naqi.columns = aqi.columns.str.replace(' ','_')\n\n# select data only from Santa Barbara County\naqi_sb = aqi[ aqi['county_name'] == 'Santa Barbara']\n\n# remove state name, county name, state code, and county_code columns\naqi_sb = aqi_sb.drop(columns = ['state_name', 'county_name', 'state_code', 'county_code'])\n\n# update date column of aqi_sb to be datetime object\naqi_sb['date'] = pd.to_datetime(aqi_sb['date']) \n\n# update the index of aqi_sb to be the date column\naqi_sb.set_index('date', inplace = True)\n\n# 5 day rolling window calculation\naqi_sb.aqi.rolling('5D').mean()\n\n# add five_day_average to aqi_sb dataframe\naqi_sb['five_day_average'] = aqi_sb.aqi.rolling('5D').mean()\n\n\nThe 2017 and 2018 AQI datasets were read in as two separate objects, so the first step was to combine both of the datasets. Additionally, the column names were not in lower snake case, so, to streamline any next steps, I reassigned column names to lower snake case by converting all column names to lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores. We are only analyzing Santa Barbara county to understand the impacts of the Thomas Fire, so it was important to filter for data only in Santa Barbara county. Because we are only looking at one county, the state name, county name, state code, and county codes were unecessary, so they were dropped. The last steps to take were to convert the date column to be a datetime object and to calculate the five day rolling averages of the AQI.\nPrepare Landsat & California Fire Perimeter Data\n\n\nCode\n# drop band from landsat data\nlandsat = landsat.squeeze().drop('band')\n\n# set california fire perimeter crs to landsat crs\ncal_fire = cal_fire.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)\n\n# select for thomas fire perimeter\nthomas_fire = cal_fire[cal_fire['FIRE_NAME'] == 'THOMAS']\n\n\nThe preparation for the Landsat and California fire perimeter data was much quicker. The Landsat satellite data had an extra dimension, so I dropped the ‘band’ dimension in order to make it 2D. I then converted the fire perimeter data to have the same CRS as the Landsat data and subsetted the fire perimeter data to include only the Thomas Fire perimeter.\n\n\nVisualizations\nUsing the prepared data, I plotted the AQI over time, as well as a false color image of the Thomas Fire Perimeter.\nDaily AQI and 5-day Average\nThe following graph shows the daily air quality index and five day average of air quality index over time. We can see that there is a large peak at the end of 2017, which is when the Thomas Fire first began. We can infer that the Thomas Fire caused in increase in air quality index during this time.\n\n\nCode\n# plot daily AQI and 5-day average\naqi_sb.plot(y = ['aqi', 'five_day_average'],\n            xlabel = 'Date',\n            title = 'AQI and AQI 5 day average over time')\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily AQI and 5-day AQI Average over time\n\n\nThomas Fire Perimeter over False Color Image\nThe following plot shows the Thomas Fire perimeter, colored by false color imagery, and the Thomas Fire perimeter is bordered in black. The false color imagery shows a large burn scar in the area in which the Thomas fire occured.\n\n\nCode\n\n# create thomas fire perimeter plot\n# create axis\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# plot thomas fire perimeter\nthomas_fire.plot(ax = ax,\n                 facecolor=\"none\",\n                 edgecolor = 'black')\n\n# plot the false color image\nlandsat[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True)\n\n# set the title \nax.set_title('Thomas Fire Perimeter in Santa Barbara/Ventura County (False Color Imagery)', \n             fontsize = 15,\n             x=0.5, y=1.1) # move title up\n\n# show plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Fire Perimeter over False Color Image to visualize burn scar"

At each site, we attempted to catch fifteen tadpoles of each species present. We were able to sample three species: Bufo boreas (BUBO), Pseudacris regilla (PSRE), and Rana catesbeiana (RACA). Each Tadpole was swabbed around the mouth and gosner stage was determined using a guide. In the lab, DNA was extracted from each swab, and qPCR was carried out to determine infection and zoospore loads."

    "text": "Analysis\nTidy Data\nThe first step of the analysis was to read in the data, select for the variables used for the analysis, and combine into one dataframe. The PCR results and field notes were in separate files, so I read in both files and dropped columns of variables that were not necessary for this analysis. I then combined both of the dataframes into a single dataset which included the variables tadpole ID, swab ID, site, species, infection status, zoospore load, and Gosner stage. Tadpoles 46 and 51 had high Gosner stages, meaning that their limbs were almost completely developed, so those individuals were swabbed in two ways: one around the mouth and one on their feet, legs, and sides2. Due to this, tadpoles 46 and 51 have two observations in the dataframe, so I dropped the swab IDs 46B and 51B, which were the feet, legs, and sides swabs. Swab IDs 46A and 51A, the mouth swabs, were kept to keep swabbing methods consistent among all observations. The resulting dataframe contained the necessary variables to continue with the analysis.\n\n\nCode\n# load in packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(broom)\n\n# tadpole swab data (pcr)\ntadswab &lt;- read.csv(\"data/tadswab_data.csv\") %&gt;% \n  select(-pcr_notes, -pcr_resultsfile, -date_collected, -pcr_inhibited, -pcr_qty, -pcr_ct, -pcr_ipc_ct) # this column is just full of NA\n\n# information about each tadpole\ntad_info &lt;- read.csv(\"data/tad_info.csv\") %&gt;% \n  select(-date_collected, -notes) # take out date collected to minimize final dataset\n\n# add tad info to tadswab data\ncomplete_tadpole &lt;- left_join(tadswab, tad_info) %&gt;% \n  relocate(site, .after = swab_id) %&gt;% \n  relocate(spp, .after = site) %&gt;% \n  subset(swab_id != \"tad_046_B\") %&gt;% \n  subset(swab_id != \"tad_051_B\")\n\n# convert infected column to factor instead of numeric\ncomplete_tadpole$infected &lt;- as.factor(complete_tadpole$infected)\n\n\nLogit Function\n\n\nCode\nggplot(complete_tadpole) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = stage_gs, y = infected, color = spp)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"BUBO\" = \"pink2\", \n                                \"RACA\" = \"cornflowerblue\", \n                                \"PSRE\" = \"palegreen3\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Infected status by Gosner stage\", \n       x = \"Gosner stage\", \n       y = \"Infected Status (binary)\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: visualizing which individuals were infected based on Gosner stage by species\n\n\nInfection status was determined by PCR and exists as a binary variable of 0 or 1, with a value of 1 indicating infection. I decided to run a logit function to understand the how Gosner stage and species can act as a predictor of the probability of infection. Using the glm() function in R with the family argument assigned as “binomial”, I ran two separate logit functions: one with only Gosner stage as an explanatory variable, and the other with both Gosner stage and species as explanatory variables.\n\n\nCode\n# logit function - gosner stage and infection\ninfection_glm &lt;- glm(infected ~ stage_gs, data = complete_tadpole, family = \"binomial\")\n\n# logit function - gosner stage, species, and infection\ninfection_glm2 &lt;- glm(infected ~ stage_gs + spp, data = complete_tadpole, family = \"binomial\")\n\n#summary(infection_glm)\n#summary(infection_glm2)\n\n\nUpon checking the outputs of each model, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) score shows that the model using both Gosner stage and species as explanatory variables is a better fit, so I decided to continue my analysis with this model. The AIC score for this model was 43.44, while the model using only Gosner stage as a predictor was 78.72.\nI thought that the best way to understand the patterns resulting from the logit function would be to calculate the predicted probabilities and odds ratio of infection. To do this, I used the logit function model to generate predicted probabilities using the augment function..\n\n\nCode\n# calculate predicted odds of second model\npredicted &lt;- infection_glm2 %&gt;%\n  augment(type.predict = \"response\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(y_hat = .fitted)\n\n\nT-test\nInitially, I wanted to run a t-test (or ANOVA depending on number of infected species) to determine whether the mean zoospore loads were different among different species. However, given that only five PSREs and eight RACAs were infected out of the sample population, I decided that the t-test was not appropriate for this time. However, in any future sampling with a larger population of infected individuals, I would like to run a t-test/ANOVA to understand zoospore loads in relation to species.\nIn the future, when running this t-test, I will define the null and alternative hypotheses. The null hypothesis would be that, among those with infection, there is no difference in mean zoospore load between different species; the alternative hypothesis would be that there is a difference in mean zoospore load between different species. After running the test, if the p-value is below a significance level of α = 0.05, then I will reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in mean zoospore load between those infected of different species, but if the p-value is above the significance level, then I will fail to reject the null hypothesis."

The full data included tadpole ID, swab ID, date collected, species, Gosner stage, site, zoospore load, PCR results, notes in individual tadpoles, and site attributes (observations, water clarity, temperature, pH, etc).\nData collection\nIn June 2023, ninety-four tadpoles were collected and swabbed across five ponds at Blue Oak Ranch Reserve, which one of the reserves part of the UC Natural Reserve System. At each site, we attempted to catch fifteen tadpoles of each species present. We were able to sample three species: Bufo boreas (BUBO), Pseudacris regilla (PSRE), and Rana catesbeiana (RACA). Each Tadpole was swabbed around the mouth and Gosner stage was determined using a guide. In the lab, DNA was extracted from each swab, and qPCR was carried out to determine infection and zoospore loads."

    "text": "Results\nWhen looking at predicted probabilities of infection among species, it shows that RACAs have a 100% probability of being infected regardless of Gosner stage, while BUBOs have a close to 0% probability of being infected regardless of Gosner stage. It is important to note that among all of the RACAs sampled, all of them happened to be infected, which would skew the results of probability. Because 100% of the RACAs sampled were infected, the model calculated a 100% probability of all RACAs being infected. Additionally, out of the sixteen BUBOs sampled, none were found to be infected, which means that the model would predict a 0% probability that any BUBO would be infected. Because there were seventy PSREs sampled across the largest range of Gosner stages, this trend is likely the most accurate in describing the relationship between Gosner stage and probability of infection. The results from the PSRE relastionship does show an slight upward trend of an increase in probability of infection as Gosner stage increases. Although the probability only slightly increases, intuitively, this makes sense considering the longer a tadpole is living, the more time it has to encounter Bd. Additionally, larger tadpoles would likely have large mouthparts, giving Bd a larger surface area to infect.\n\n\nCode\n# plot odds ratio by gosner stage and species\nggplot(predicted, aes(x = stage_gs, y = y_hat, color = spp)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"BUBO\" = \"pink2\", \"RACA\" = \"cornflowerblue\", \"PSRE\" = \"palegreen3\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(y = \"predicted probability of infection\", x = \"Gosner stage\", title = \"Predicted odds of infection by Gosner stage\") +\n  geom_line() +\n  xlim(20,45) +\n  ylim(-0.25,1.25)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: This plot shows the predicted probabilities of infection (determined by the logit function model).

However, I would not use any of the results from this study to predict true patterns in nature. This is because one of the main limitations in this study was the lack of data points. The data was collected over a one week span in June 2023, and we were only able to process ninety-four samples across five ponds. Although we attempted to catch fifteen of each species at each pond, the only species that was collected across all five ponds were PSREs. RACAs were only found at one pond, and BUBOs were also only found at one pond. We only sampled the tadpoles that we could find and catch at each site, which may have led to sampling bias. The limited number and spread of species in our sampling definitely skewed the results, and we would get more accurate trends and predictions with a much larger sample.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(complete_tadpole, aes(fill = infected, x = site))+\n  geom_bar() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~spp) +\n  labs(title = \"Proportion of infected tadpoles per site by species\",\n       y = \"Count\",\n       x = \"Site\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: we can visualize which species, and how many, were sampled at each pond, as well as which were found to be infected\n\n\nMoving forward\nAs discussed before, it would be interesting to carry out this analysis again, but with a large sample size, and more individuals of each species. If there is a large enough sample size of infection within each species, I could conduct a t-test or ANOVA to determine if there is also a significant difference in zoospore load across infected individuals of different species. With more sampling evenness across sites, I would also like to look at site as a predictor of infection status as well. If site proves to be a significant indicator in predicting infection, then it would be useful to look at chemical and physical site attributes to potentially understand the relationship between abiotic environmental factors and Bd infection rates.\nAdditionally, we could use the data on tadpole infection rates to understand the relationship between mature amphibian infection rates and larval infection rates."
