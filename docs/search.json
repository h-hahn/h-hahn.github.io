    "text": "Professional LifePersonal life\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto taken by me during field work\n\n\n\nLakes, streams, and the ocean have always captivated me, and for as long as I can remember, being in these environments have scratched a part of my brain like nothing else ever has. Going to the aquarium as a child, seeing miniature versions of these ecosystems, and witnessing how perfectly our planet sets up homes and roles for fish to fill was incredible to me. Fast forward to majoring in aquatic biology for my undergraduate degree at the University of California, Santa Barbara: learning more about general and aquatic ecology made me realize how interconnected our world is, and our natural planet is just composed of the same principles over different landscapes. Nature repeats itself in different forms, and understanding the underlying concepts of how living things interact with the physical world can explain a multitude of patterns we see from the sea to land (for some reason, I remember the intermediate disturbance hypothesis being so fascinating to me specifically). The only way to preserve our beautiful planet is to understand how it functions.\nAfter taking a biometry course and working in a research lab at UCSB, I became very interested in statistics and understanding how we use data to explain research results, and in effect, our environment. This drove me to pursue a Master’s degree in Environmental Data Science through the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, which I completed in June 2024. During this program, I learned a lot more about proper data practices and more sophisticated types of analyses while improving my coding skills in R and Python. I also had the opportunity to work on a project with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and CalCOFI to create a tool for Southern California anglers to use and receive personalized information about the risks of consuming their locally caught seafood (look at the website here!). This degree increased my interest in data and coding, and I now have a new skill set to use in conjunction with my original interest in research and ecology.\nNature is beautiful and providing, and I still hold onto the importance of understanding our environment to learn how to use our resources responsibly and preserve our planet for future generations to enjoy. I hope to continue to use my experiences in research, data science, and biology to ultimately help others better understand our natural world and assist in making informed decisions about future research and conservation efforts. I am also always interested in learning more about how to apply data in novel, helpful ways to expand our field of knowledge!\n\n\nA little photo gallery :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGathering samples from bullfrogs in the field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tiniest Bufo Boreas you will ever see!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cows are my favorite part about field work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDucks in Switzerland\n\n\n\nIn my personal life, I enjoy trying new hobbies and always try to find joy in the little things. For one, I love taking photos of duck pairs and have a large collection of duck friends (see photo above!). I have had my fun with painting, camping, crocheting, and I am always excited to try new crafts. In this moment of time, I have been spending a lot of my time hiking, gardening, and running!"

    "title": "HW4 - Looking at change in benthic structure on Moorea Coral Reefs",
    "section": "Discussion on Plot Choices",
    "text": "Discussion on Plot Choices\n\nGraphic Form\nFor the graph geared toward the general audience, I decided to create radar charts. I think that radar charts look very interesting and draw the eye. I think a line chart for a plot geared toward a general audience would have looked too plain and “boring”. I think because line charts can be seen as the typical “scientific” or “math-y” types of plots it might seem less interesting to people. Even though radar charts may not be as intuitive as line charts or bar charts, which are more common, I think they add an artistic element to a visualization. A lot of my favorite examples I’ve seen so far have been a series of radar charts. Because this visualization can look slightly more artistic than for a publication or presentation, I stuck to a set of radar charts.\nWhile the radar charts for a general audience show an overall result of 2005 to 2023 rather than all the years between. I wanted to use a time series line chart for the publication because scientists would be able to see more nuanced trends throughout all the years. Rather than from just 2005 and 2023. The accompanying paper would explain these patterns, perhaps indicating other global factors that may be driving the trends. They would be able to reference these plots by site and year.\nFor the presentation graph, I wanted to do something similar to the publication graph, but instead of facet wrapping by site (this makes it harder to look at quickly), I decided to do the average trend over all sites for one large time series graph.\nText\nThe title for the general audience plot is more explanatory than the other graphs because it is a standalone plot versus being accompanied by a paper or speech. I tried to avoid scientific jargon such as “benthic” so an average person would be able to relate to the message more. The titles of the other plots just say exactly what it is. I avoided plot annotations for my graph for publication due to the fact that everything can be explained in the paper, and this plot contains a figure caption which all publication graphs have. I added text annotations to the presentation visualization to explain simple observations, but avoided explaining too much because I did not want to make it too visually crowded. The more complex patterns in this plot can be explained by the presenter. All axis text is exactly what it means. I was wary of the axis text in the radar charts, but ultimately decided to keep it.\nThemes\nAll plots are plain, and only the radar charts have gridlines. I didn’t think that the gridlines were necessary since the plot portrays general trends, and it is not too important to be able to match up very specific years to points. Plain backgrounds make plots cleaner and very easy to read. I adjusted the padding for all graphs to increase distance between text and other graphs. This makes graphs easier to interpret without elements being too squished together. Title texts were all bolded to draw more attention and stand apart from the rest of the graph more. I used Libre Baskerville for title text and Source Sans 3 for body text because I found this pairing from fontpair and thought that it looked nice and classy.\nColors\nThe colors I chose for the radar chart were a muted blue and red because I think these are very contradictory and it is easy to distinguish them from each other. I did not use the default red and blue because I think these are very bright and hurt the eyes sometimes. For the other plots, I chose coral color to represent the coral lines and used a green to represent the algae lines. I think this is intuitive to most people since most people think algae is green and the color coral is self explanatory. I liked that the colors matched what it was representing. All text is black or dark grey, which are easy to read and not too distracting.\nTypography\nI touched on fonts I used in the section above, but ultimately I used a font pairing that I really liked from fontpair. I like serif fonts being titles and sans-serif for body text so I followed this pattern. I used the same font combination for all plots because I think it looks clean and classy.\nGeneral Design\nAll plots with multiple sites are ordered numerically since all plots contain numbers in their names. I added padding between most elements to make sure that nothing was too crowded and to make it easier to look at. For the presentation graph, I also made the linewidth and text thicker to make all elements easier to see. I touched on some of the general design elements above as well.\nContextualizing Your Data\nMost of the contextualization of my data is in the first two plots with annotations and captions. I did not go into any technical detail for plot 1 because it is for a general audience, and for plots 2 and 3, I figured that the explanation of data/wrangling/workflow would be described in the paper and during a presentation. I tried to keep the last one as simple as possible because I figured that this graph would be supplemented by verbal explanations and descriptions as well.\nCentering Your Primary Message\nAll graphs are right in the middle of all text. I think this is the first thing that your eyes look at, and then you look around for more information. I think the trends that are on the graphs are the main message, and then the viewer can look at the surrounding text for more context\nConsidering Accessibility\nI tried to add more contrast in the text by bolding and not bolding to make the main text easier to read. Unfortunately, I believe that the colors that I used for the last two plots were not color blind friendly. To make up for this, I used different linetypes for the two groups, so if someone is not able to distinguish the colors, they would be able to distinguish the line types.\nApplying a DEI Lens to Your Design\nBecause my data handles very objective environmental data, I did not consider a lot about how this data is represented from a DEI lens. This data is not directly portraying any communities or people, and the questions I posed for this assignment, is very observational and I did not see it as affecting any individuals or communities negatively. I am open to other thoughts on this point of view though!"

The following analysis looks at the burn scars of the Thomas fire with false color imagery as well as the Air Quality Index over time; including the time period of the Thomas fire in December 2017. The datasets used in this analysis include: air quality data from the US Environmental Protection Agency, Landsat satellite data, and California fire perimeter data.\n\nThe datasets:\nCalifornia Fire Perimeter - A shapefile of fire perimeters in California during 2017. The complete file can be accessed in the CA state geoportal.\nAir Quality Index - Air Quality Index data from the US Environmental Protection Agency.\nLandsat Satellite Data - A simplified collection of bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared) from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 atmosperically corrected surface reflectance data, collected by the Landsat 8 satellite. The data was accessed and pre-processed in the Microsoft Planetary Computer to remove data outside land and coarsen the spatial resolution (Landsat Collection in MPC).

    "text": "The Analysis\nImport Libraries\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport rioxarray as rioxr\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\n\nData Wrangling and Tidying\nImport Datasets\n\n\nCode\n# read in data for 2017 daily AQI by county\naqi_17 = pd.read_csv('https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/daily_aqi_by_county_2017.zip')\n\n# read data for 2018 Daily AQI by county\naqi_18 = pd.read_csv('https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/daily_aqi_by_county_2018.zip')\n\n# import landsat file\nlandsat1 = os.path.join(os.getcwd(),'data','landsat8-2018-01-26-sb-simplified.nc')\nlandsat = rioxr.open_rasterio(landsat1)\n\n# import fire perimiters dataset\ncal_fire = gpd.read_file('data/California_Fire_Perimeters_2017')\n\n\nThe first step of this analysis was to read in the data. Air quality index datasets (by county) for 2017 and 2018 were read in from .zip files accessed through the US EPA. I used rioxarray.open_rasterio() to read in the landsat satellite data and geopandas.read_file() to read in the California fire perimeters data.\nThen the datasets needed to be cleaned to prepare for visualization:\nPrepare AQI Data\n\n\nCode\n# preparing aqi data\n\n# glue dataframes together\naqi = pd.concat([aqi_17, aqi_18])\n\n# re-assign the column names - .str.lower() makes them lower case\naqi.columns = aqi.columns.str.lower()\n\n#  re-assign the column names again - .str.replace(' ','_') replaces the space for _\naqi.columns = aqi.columns.str.replace(' ','_')\n\n# select data only from Santa Barbara County\naqi_sb = aqi[ aqi['county_name'] == 'Santa Barbara']\n\n# remove state name, county name, state code, and county_code columns\naqi_sb = aqi_sb.drop(columns = ['state_name', 'county_name', 'state_code', 'county_code'])\n\n# update date column of aqi_sb to be datetime object\naqi_sb['date'] = pd.to_datetime(aqi_sb['date']) \n\n# update the index of aqi_sb to be the date column\naqi_sb.set_index('date', inplace = True)\n\n# 5 day rolling window calculation\naqi_sb.aqi.rolling('5D').mean()\n\n# add five_day_average to aqi_sb dataframe\naqi_sb['five_day_average'] = aqi_sb.aqi.rolling('5D').mean()\n\n\nThe 2017 and 2018 AQI datasets were read in as two separate objects, so the first step was to combine both of the datasets. Additionally, the column names were not in lower snake case, so, to streamline any next steps, I reassigned column names to lower snake case by converting all column names to lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores. We are only analyzing Santa Barbara county to understand the impacts of the Thomas Fire, so it was important to filter for data only in Santa Barbara county. Because we are only looking at one county, the state name, county name, state code, and county codes were unecessary, so they were dropped. The last steps to take were to convert the date column to be a datetime object and to calculate the five day rolling averages of the AQI.\nPrepare Landsat & California Fire Perimeter Data\n\n\nCode\n# drop band from landsat data\nlandsat = landsat.squeeze().drop('band')\n\n# set california fire perimeter crs to landsat crs\ncal_fire = cal_fire.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)\n\n# select for thomas fire perimeter\nthomas_fire = cal_fire[cal_fire['FIRE_NAME'] == 'THOMAS']\n\n\nThe preparation for the Landsat and California fire perimeter data was much quicker. The Landsat satellite data had an extra dimension, so I dropped the ‘band’ dimension in order to make it 2D. I then converted the fire perimeter data to have the same CRS as the Landsat data and subsetted the fire perimeter data to include only the Thomas Fire perimeter.\n\n\nVisualizations\nUsing the prepared data, I plotted the AQI over time, as well as a false color image of the Thomas Fire Perimeter.\nDaily AQI and 5-day Average\nThe following graph shows the daily air quality index and five day average of air quality index over time. We can see that there is a large peak at the end of 2017, which is when the Thomas Fire first began. We can infer that the Thomas Fire caused in increase in air quality index during this time.\n\n\nCode\n# plot daily AQI and 5-day average\naqi_sb.plot(y = ['aqi', 'five_day_average'],\n            xlabel = 'Date',\n            title = 'AQI and AQI 5 day average over time')\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily AQI and 5-day AQI Average over time\n\n\nThomas Fire Perimeter over False Color Image\nThe following plot shows the Thomas Fire perimeter, colored by false color imagery, and the Thomas Fire perimeter is bordered in black. The false color imagery shows a large burn scar in the area in which the Thomas fire occured.\n\n\nCode\n\n# create thomas fire perimeter plot\n# create axis\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# plot thomas fire perimeter\nthomas_fire.plot(ax = ax,\n                 facecolor=\"none\",\n                 edgecolor = 'black')\n\n# plot the false color image\nlandsat[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True)\n\n# set the title \nax.set_title('Thomas Fire Perimeter in Santa Barbara/Ventura County (False Color Imagery)', \n             fontsize = 15,\n             x=0.5, y=1.1) # move title up\n\n# show plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Fire Perimeter over False Color Image to visualize burn scar"

    "text": "Bias in Ecological Research\n\nA preface on my own thoughts and experience in research\nAlthough I have been working in environmental research for the past few years (my own background involves amphibian disease), I am embarrassed to admit that I have yet to consider how bias is involved in my own field of research, especially as the research I have been performing does not directly relate to humans. I used to think that biases only impacted underrepresented communities of humans and thought about it in terms of socio-economic impacts, but have not thought of how biases affect conservation and ecology as well. The scales that I work on are so small and local, that I rarely consider wide scale impacts of our research, and in my undergraduate courses, I would absorb all of the ecological concepts without considering where this research takes place and how bias can be involved in the collection of this information. It is interesting to consider how bias arises in ecology and conservation on global scales.\n\n\nThe importance in representing all areas in ecology\nMany studies establish ecological concepts that are meant to be applied to a wide range of environments regardless of location. Due to the fact that these principles and concepts are applied to such a wide range of habitats and systems, it is important to consider the origins of this research; however if there are biases excluding certain environmental systems, we must be wary and careful in applying these broad ecological ideas to any system.\n\n\nGlobal patterns of bias\nAround the world, there appears to be a pattern in which sampling and research locations are not evenly distributed - based on the most “popular” ecological research, determined by publications from 10 highly cited ecology journals. In 2012, Martin et al. analyzed the global distribution of 2573 terrestrial ecological studies and found that there are many biases in the locations chosen to conduct ecological research. The figure below is figure 1 from Martin et al. (2012), showing the proportion of studies in different land contexts.\n\nThis figure shows that agriculture and densely settled locations are largely underrepresented compared to the actual proportion of land that they take up globally. On the other hand, protected areas are largely overrepresented. Intuitively, it makes sense that scientists are focused on conservation in protected areas, as these areas are likely protected for a reason. However, this does not mean that other locations should be disregarded. The lack of research in densely settled populations is ironic, especially when considering that most research in densely settled areas are conducted in the “natural” parts of these locations (Martin et al. 2012), as the lack of research hinders conservation in these areas, and these locations are likely areas where anthropogenic impacts are deteriorating “natural” systems at faster rates. One would think that we would want to study anthropogenic impacts in densely settled areas more aggressively than areas that are already protected.\nAdditionally, on a country scale, “the Middle East was the most significantly understudied region based on land area, by a factor of 8.3, followed by Africa, Asia, and South America” (Martin et al. 2012). Countries with higher gross national incomes (GNI) are largely overstudied, with 90% of the studies taking place in countries in the 70-100th percentiles of GNI (Martin et al. 2012). (Zina Skandrani digs into the cause of the bias against North Africa and the Middle East in “Decolonizing ecological research”!)\n\n\n\nThis map is from figure 3a of Martin et al. 2012, depicting the global distribution of ecological field sites.\n\n\nDisregarding the environmental justice issues that these statistics imply, almost completely leaving out certain countries means that many different types of biomes are being left out of ecological research. When the same types of biomes are being repeatedly sampled, we must be careful to extrapolate ecological principles to all biomes. In particular, the biases against countries with low GNI has led to underrepresentation of desert ecosystems (Durant et al. 2012).\nWhen considering the conclusions of ecological research, we must be vigilant and responsible in considering how biases in study location can affect the implications of the results of the study. If most studies are conducted in wealthy countries with temperate biomes, we cannot confidently apply those broad ecological concepts to less wealthy countries with desert biomes. When ecologists do not consider biases in study locations, they are also skewing conservation efforts, as conservation efforts are neglected in areas that are not being studied.\n\n\nAdditional Thoughts\nAs I was researching bias in ecological research, I also came across a paper addressing the understanding of bias among ecologists. According to the study, knowledge and understanding of bias among ecologists is low, and early career scientists are more likely to understand bias and measures to prevent it than senior scientists (Zvereva & Kozlov 2021). I would be curious to understand whether this is because early career scientists have more recently learned about biases more recently, or because when senior scientists first entered their careers, discussion about bias was less common. In either case, would continuing education on biases and avoiding biases help keep scientists more accountable? Zvereva and Kozlov introduce the idea of obligatory reporting measures taken against biases to enhance reproducibility, which links to the idea of datasheets for datasets, introduced by Gebru et al., which may not be a bad idea in the field of ecology.\n\n\nReferences\nDurant SM, Pettorelli N, Bashir S, Woodroffe R, Wacher T, de Ornellas P, Ransom C, Abaigar T, Abdelgardir M, Elalqamy H, Beddiaf M, Belbachir F, Belbachir-Bazi A, Berbash AA, Beudels-Jamar R, Boitani L, Breitenmoser C, Cano M, Chardonnet P, Collen B, Corniforth WA, Cuzin F, Gerngross P, Haddane B, Hadjeloum M, Jacobson A, Jebali A, Lamarque F, Mallon D, Minkowski K, Monfort S, Ndossal B, Newby J, Ngakoutou BE, Niagate b, Purchase G, Smaila S, Samna AK, Sillero-Zubiri C, Soultan AE, Price MRS, Baillie JEM.

At each site, we attempted to catch fifteen tadpoles of each species present. We were able to sample three species: Bufo boreas (BUBO), Pseudacris regilla (PSRE), and Rana catesbeiana (RACA). Each Tadpole was swabbed around the mouth and Gosner stage was determined using a guide. In the lab, DNA was extracted from each swab, and qPCR was carried out to determine infection and zoospore loads."

    "text": "Analysis\nTidy Data\nThe first step of the analysis was to read in the data, select for the variables used for the analysis, and combine into one dataframe. The PCR results and field notes were in separate files, so I read in both files and dropped columns of variables that were not necessary for this analysis. I then combined both of the dataframes into a single dataset which included the variables tadpole ID, swab ID, site, species, infection status, zoospore load, and Gosner stage. Tadpoles 46 and 51 had high Gosner stages, meaning that their limbs were almost completely developed, so those individuals were swabbed in two ways: one around the mouth and one on their feet, legs, and sides2. Due to this, tadpoles 46 and 51 have two observations in the dataframe, so I dropped the swab IDs 46B and 51B, which were the feet, legs, and sides swabs. Swab IDs 46A and 51A, the mouth swabs, were kept to keep swabbing methods consistent among all observations. The resulting dataframe contained the necessary variables to continue with the analysis.\n\n\nCode\n# load in packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(broom)\n\n# tadpole swab data (pcr)\ntadswab &lt;- read.csv(\"data/tadswab_data.csv\") %&gt;% \n  select(-pcr_notes, -pcr_resultsfile, -date_collected, -pcr_inhibited, -pcr_qty, -pcr_ct, -pcr_ipc_ct) # this column is just full of NA\n\n# information about each tadpole\ntad_info &lt;- read.csv(\"data/tad_info.csv\") %&gt;% \n  select(-date_collected, -notes) # take out date collected to minimize final dataset\n\n# add tad info to tadswab data\ncomplete_tadpole &lt;- left_join(tadswab, tad_info) %&gt;% \n  relocate(site, .after = swab_id) %&gt;% \n  relocate(spp, .after = site) %&gt;% \n  subset(swab_id != \"tad_046_B\") %&gt;% \n  subset(swab_id != \"tad_051_B\")\n\n# convert infected column to factor instead of numeric\ncomplete_tadpole$infected &lt;- as.factor(complete_tadpole$infected)\n\n\nLogit Function\n\n\nCode\nggplot(complete_tadpole) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = stage_gs, y = infected, color = spp)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"BUBO\" = \"pink2\", \n                                \"RACA\" = \"cornflowerblue\", \n                                \"PSRE\" = \"palegreen3\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Infected status by Gosner stage\", \n       x = \"Gosner stage\", \n       y = \"Infected Status (binary)\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: visualizing which individuals were infected based on Gosner stage by species\n\n\nInfection status was determined by PCR and exists as a binary variable of 0 or 1, with a value of 1 indicating infection. I wanted to analyze infection as dependent variable, so it was necessary to run a logistic regression so we could understand infection status as a continuous variable. Using a logistic regression allowed me to see how probability of infection changed with a change in the explanatory variables. I decided to use a logit function to understand the how Gosner stage and species can act as a predictor of the probability of infection. Using the glm() function in R with the family argument assigned as “binomial”, I ran two separate logit functions: one with only Gosner stage as an explanatory variable, and the other with both Gosner stage and species as explanatory variables.\n\n\nCode\n# logit function - gosner stage and infection\ninfection_glm &lt;- glm(infected ~ stage_gs, data = complete_tadpole, family = \"binomial\")\n\n# logit function - gosner stage, species, and infection\ninfection_glm2 &lt;- glm(infected ~ stage_gs + spp, data = complete_tadpole, family = \"binomial\")\n\n#summary(infection_glm)\n#summary(infection_glm2)\n\n\nUpon checking the outputs of each model, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) score shows that the model using both Gosner stage and species as explanatory variables is a better fit, so I decided to continue my analysis with this model. The AIC score for this model was 43.44, while the model using only Gosner stage as a predictor was 78.72.\nI thought that the best way to understand the results of the logit function would be to calculate the predicted probabilities of infection in relation to Gosner stage. To do this, I used the logit function model to generate predicted probabilities using the augment function.\n\n\nCode\n# calculate predicted odds of second model\npredicted &lt;- infection_glm2 %&gt;%\n  augment(type.predict = \"response\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(y_hat = .fitted)\n\n\nT-test\nInitially, I wanted to run a t-test (or ANOVA depending on number of infected species) to determine whether the mean zoospore loads were different among different species. However, given that only five PSREs and eight RACAs were infected out of the sample population, I decided that the t-test was not appropriate for this time. However, in any future sampling with a larger population of infected individuals, I would like to run a t-test/ANOVA to understand if zoospore loads differ across different species.\nIn the future, when running this t-test, I will define the null and alternative hypotheses. The null hypothesis would be that, among those with infection, there is no difference in mean zoospore load between different species; the alternative hypothesis would be that there is a difference in mean zoospore load between different species. After running the test, if the p-value is below a significance level of α = 0.05, then I will reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in mean zoospore load between those infected of different species, but if the p-value is above the significance level, then I will fail to reject the null hypothesis."

    "text": "Results\nWhen looking at predicted probabilities of infection among species, it shows that RACAs have a 100% probability of being infected regardless of Gosner stage, while BUBOs have a close to 0% probability of being infected regardless of Gosner stage. It is important to note that among all of the RACAs sampled, all of them happened to be infected, which skewed the results of probability. Because 100% of the RACAs sampled were infected, the model calculated a 100% probability of all RACAs being infected. Additionally, out of the sixteen BUBOs sampled, none were found to be infected, which means that the model predicted a 0% probability that any BUBO would be infected. Because there were seventy PSREs sampled across the largest range of Gosner stages, this trend is likely the most accurate (out of the sampled species) in describing the relationship between Gosner stage and probability of infection. The results from the PSRE relationship does show an slight upward trend of an increase in probability of infection as Gosner stage increases. Intuitively, this makes sense considering the longer a tadpole is living, the more time it has to encounter Bd. Additionally, larger tadpoles would likely have large mouthparts, giving Bd a larger surface area to infect. If I had a larger sample size of RACAs and BUBOs, I would expect that there would be a similar trend among all species.\n\n\nCode\n# plot odds ratio by gosner stage and species\nggplot(predicted, aes(x = stage_gs, y = y_hat, color = spp)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"BUBO\" = \"pink2\", \"RACA\" = \"cornflowerblue\", \"PSRE\" = \"palegreen3\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(y = \"predicted probability of infection\", x = \"Gosner stage\", title = \"Predicted odds of infection by Gosner stage\") +\n  geom_line() +\n  xlim(20,45) +\n  ylim(-0.25,1.25)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: This plot shows the predicted probabilities of infection (determined by the logit function model).

    "text": "Discussion\nLimitations\nThis analysis stands as a good starting point in analyzing tadpoles in relation to Bd and sets up an analysis to replicate with a larger sample of tadpoles in the future. However, I would not use any of the results from this study to predict true patterns in nature. This is because one of the main limitations in this study was the lack of data points. The data was collected over a one week span in June 2023, and we were only able to process ninety-four samples across five ponds. Although we attempted to catch fifteen of each species at each pond, the only species that was collected across all five ponds were PSREs. RACAs were only found at one pond, and BUBOs were also only found at one pond. We only sampled the tadpoles that we could find and catch at each site, which may have led to sampling bias. The limited number and evenness of species in our sampling definitely skewed the results, and we would get more accurate trends and predictions with a much larger, even sample.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(complete_tadpole, aes(fill = infected, x = site))+\n  geom_bar() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~spp) +\n  labs(title = \"Proportion of infected tadpoles per site by species\",\n       y = \"Count\",\n       x = \"Site\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: we can visualize which species, and how many, were sampled at each pond, as well as which were found to be infected\n\n\nMoving forward\nAs discussed before, it would be interesting to carry out this analysis again, but with a large sample size, and more individuals of each species. If there is a large enough sample size of infection within each species, I could conduct a t-test or ANOVA to determine if there is also a significant difference in zoospore load across infected individuals of different species. With more sampling evenness across sites, I would also like to look at site as a predictor of infection status as well. If site proves to be a significant indicator in predicting infection, then it would be useful to look at chemical and physical site attributes to potentially understand the relationship between abiotic environmental factors and Bd infection rates.\nAdditionally, we could use the data on tadpole infection rates to understand the relationship between mature amphibian infection rates and larval infection rates. After conducting further analysis, we will be able to better understand the role of tadpoles as a vector and reservoir of Bd and better understand how Bd interacts with the environment as a whole."

The purpose of this project is to inform what EEZs are suitable for marine aquaculture of different commercial species on the West Coast. To do this, I will create a function that will take depth and temparature conditions, species name, and the datasets to output maps appropriate for selected species."

    "text": "Analysis\nData Preparation\nIn order to create a function, I first manipulated the datasets to prepare them as inputs into the function. The datasets I manipulated were sea surface temperature (sst) and bathymetry rasters as well as data on the West Coast EEZs. I included sst data from 2008 to 2012 and took the mean sst during these years. Additionally, to work with both of the rasters together, it was important to match the CRS, extent, resolution and position of the sst and bathymetry rasters. The EEZ dataset was not necessary to alter to add to the function. This step allowed all three data objects to be used as inputs into the function.\n\n\nCode\n# load in packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(resample)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(maptiles)\n\n# read in west coast eez data\nwest_coast_eez &lt;- st_read(\"data/wc_regions_clean.shp\")\n\n\nReading layer `wc_regions_clean' from data source \n  `/Users/hopehahn/Documents/MEDS/WEBSITE/h-hahn.github.io/blog/2023-12-14-west-coast-eez/data/wc_regions_clean.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 5 features and 5 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -129.1635 ymin: 30.542 xmax: -117.097 ymax: 49.00031\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\nCode\n# read in sea surface temperature raster data\nsst_2008 &lt;- rast(\"data/average_annual_sst_2008.tif\")\nsst_2009 &lt;- rast(\"data/average_annual_sst_2009.tif\")\nsst_2010 &lt;- rast(\"data/average_annual_sst_2010.tif\")\nsst_2011 &lt;- rast(\"data/average_annual_sst_2011.tif\")\nsst_2012 &lt;- rast(\"data/average_annual_sst_2012.tif\")\n\n# stack the sst rasters from 2008-2012\nsst_stack &lt;- c(sst_2008,\n              sst_2009,\n              sst_2010,\n              sst_2011,\n              sst_2012)\n\n# read in bathymetry raster\nbathymetry &lt;- rast(\"data/depth.tif\")\n\n### MEAN SST FROM 2008-2012\n# raster of mean SST from 2008-2012\nmean_sst_stack &lt;- app(sst_stack, fun = mean)\n\n# convert SST data from Kelvin to Celsius\nmean_sst_stack_C &lt;- mean_sst_stack - 273.15\n\n# change crs of sst_stack to match bathymetry raster crs\nsst_stack &lt;- project(sst_stack, \"EPSG:4326\")\n\n### MATCH EXTENT, RESOLUTION, AND POSITION\n\n# crop bathymetry raster to match extent of SST raster\nbathymetry_crop &lt;- crop(x = bathymetry, y = mean_sst_stack_C)\n\n# resample data to match resolution of sst data \nresample_bath &lt;- terra::resample(bathymetry_crop, sst_stack, method = \"near\")\n\n\nCreating the Function\nThe inputs of the function are the species name, the three datasets previously prepared, and the environmental conditions required for each species (depth and temperature ranges). The function works by reclassifying the sst and bathymetry rasters to binary values, assigning a 1 for areas with matching conditions, and a 0 for areas that are unsuitable conditions, based on inputs. Overlaying the two rasters creates a raster that shows areas which match both the depth and temperature conditions.\nThe function then calculates the area of suitable area within each West Coast EEZ, and it also divides by the total area within each region, to calculate what percent of the total area match suitable conditions in each EEZ.\nUsing these areas, the function uses tmap to plot maps of the total suitable area within each EEZ as well as the percent of suitable area in each EEZ.\n\n\nCode\n# create function to accomodate for other species\n# this function assumes that rasters are the same resolution, extent, and CRS\nsuitable_area &lt;- function(species, eez_polygon, sst_rast, bath_rast, sst_lower, sst_upper, depth_lower, depth_upper) {\n  # reclassify\n  # create matrix to classify species sst ranges as 1 and everything else as NA\n  rcl_sst &lt;- matrix(c(-Inf, sst_lower, NA, \n              sst_lower, sst_upper, 1,\n              sst_upper, Inf, NA), \n              ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\n  \n  # reclassify sst stack based off of previous matrix\n  sst_stack_rcl &lt;- classify(sst_rast, rcl = rcl_sst)\n  \n  # create matrix to classify species depth ranges as 1 and everything else as NA\n  rcl_bath &lt;- matrix(c(-Inf, depth_lower, NA,\n                     depth_lower, depth_upper, 1,\n                     depth_upper, Inf, NA),\n                     ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\n  \n  # reclasify bathymetry data based off of previous matrix\n  bath_rcl &lt;- classify(bath_rast, rcl = rcl_bath)\n  \n  # find locations that satisfy both SST and depth conditions\n  satisfy_conditions &lt;- lapp(c(sst_stack_rcl, bath_rcl), \"*\")\n\n  # ---------------------------------------------------------\n  \n  # create a mask of the oyster conditions that fall in west coast eez\n  mask_eez &lt;- mask(satisfy_conditions, eez_polygon)\n\n  # rasterize data because its vector data\n  # use extent of depth raster\n  eez_rast &lt;- terra::rasterize(eez_polygon, mask_eez, field = \"rgn\")\n\n  # find area within each EEZ\n  area &lt;- expanse(mask_eez, unit = \"km\", zones = eez_rast)\n\n  # percent of each zone that is suitable\n  percent_suitable &lt;- merge(eez_polygon, area, by.x = \"rgn\", by.y = \"zone\") %&gt;% \n    mutate(percent_area = (area/area_km2)*100)\n\n  # ---------------------------------------------------------\n  \n  # plot map of total suitable area\n  tmap_mode(\"plot\")\n  \n  # plot total suitable area\n  total_area_map &lt;- tm_shape(percent_suitable) +\n    tm_polygons(\"area\",\n                palette = \"YlOrBr\",\n                title = \"Total Suitable Area\",\n                lwd = 0.2) +\n    tm_basemap(\"OpenStreetMap\")  +\n    tm_layout(legend.frame = FALSE,\n            legend.outside = TRUE) +\n    tm_compass(type = \"8star\", # add compass\n               position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"),\n               size = 3,\n               lwd = 0.2) + \n    tm_graticules(lwd = 0.2) +\n    tm_xlab(\"Longitude\", size = 0.6) +\n    tm_ylab(\"Latitude\", size = 0.6) +\n    tm_scalebar(position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")) +\n    tm_title(text = paste(\"Suitable area for\", species)) \n \n  # ---------------------------------------------------------\n  \n  # plot map of percent suitable area per EEZ\n  # plot percent suitable area by region\n  \n  percent_area_map &lt;- tm_shape(percent_suitable) +\n    tm_polygons(\"percent_area\",\n                palette = \"YlOrBr\",\n                title = \"Percent of suitable area in EEZ\",\n                lwd = 0.2)+\n    tm_basemap(\"OpenStreetMap\") +\n    tm_layout(legend.frame = FALSE,\n              legend.outside = TRUE,\n              scale = 0.8) +\n    tm_compass(type = \"8star\", \n              position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"),\n              size = 3,\n              lwd = 0.2) + \n    tm_graticules(lwd = 0.2) +\n    tm_xlab(\"Longitude\", size = 0.6) +\n    tm_ylab(\"Latitude\", size = 0.6) +\n    tm_scalebar(position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")) +\n    tm_title(text = paste(\"Percent of area suitable for\", species, \"per EEZ\")) \n  \n  # ---------------------------------------------------------\n  \n  # print the maps\n  print(total_area_map)\n  print(percent_area_map)\n\n}"

    "text": "Discussion\nBecause this function creates maps based on any inputted species, it is versatile in reproducing graphs across any commercial species. This is useful in streamlining the process of determining suitable aquaculture areas. However, there are a few limitations to this function. First, the datasets used as inputs for this function are very specific, and must be manipulated prior to using in the function. If using the same datasets that I did in the analysis, it is important to prepare them by transforming CRS, extent, position, and resolution in the same ways that I did. If using different datasets, the EEZ data must be vector data, and the bathymetry and sst data must be rasters that match in CRS, extent, position, and resolution.\nThis function also only creates maps for West Coast EEZs and does not account for conditions such as 3D complexity, substrate, nutrients, etc. It only accounts for depth and temperature. Many aquatic species depend on different environmental factors such as substrate and nutrients. In the context of aquaculture, the environment can be manipulated to accomodate for such factors, but in this case, we must also understand the environmental implications of manipulating natural resources."
