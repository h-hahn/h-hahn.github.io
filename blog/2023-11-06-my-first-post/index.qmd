Welcome to my blog! This tab of my website will keep a collection of projects that I have completed in the form of blog posts. Most of these posts were final projects from courses that I took while completing my Master's degree in Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, but I will try to continue to update this page with new posts as I develop in my career! 

Have a look around, read through some of my analyses, and enjoy!

Thanks for being here :)
