title: "About Me"
---


I have just completed a Master of Environmental Data Science in the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Aquatic Biology from UC Santa Barbara in 2022, where I became passionate about research with environmental applications. I gained experience working on molecular scales while working with DNA in various disease ecology labs. The results of my laboratory procedures were used to gain a better understanding of patterns and ecological impacts of diseases in the environment. I hope to continue to use my knowledge in data science and biology to improve the quality of ecological research by transforming data into results that have real-world, environmental applications.
