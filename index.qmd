## Hi, my name is Hope! 

I am a recent graduate from UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, where I achieved a Master's degree in Environmental Data Science. I am passionate about data driven solutions to environmental problems, and I love biology and research. 

Feel free to have a look around to see previous projects I've completed and learn more about me. Enjoy!

P.S. This website was created using Quarto in RStudio and is still a work in progress as I improve my skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
