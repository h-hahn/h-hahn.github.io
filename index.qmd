## Hi, my name is Hope! 

I am a recent graduate from UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, where I achieved a Master's degree in Environmental Data Science. I am passionate about data driven solutions to environmental problems, and I love biology and research. 

Feel free to have a look around to see previous projects I've completed and learn more about me. Enjoy!

P.S. This website was created using Quarto in RStudio and is not optimized for mobile use, so some pages might look wonky on a phone!
