## Hi, my name is Hope! 

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! 

I am a recent graduate from UCSB's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, where I achieved a Master's degree in Environmental Data Science. I am passionate about data driven solutions to environmental problems, and I love biology and research.

Please have a look around to see previous projects I've completed and learn more about me. Enjoy!
